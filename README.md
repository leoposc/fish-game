## Build

#### Dependencies

We recommend to have the libraries installed inside your `/usr/local` directory. This directory is also default directory where cmake usually installs libaries and header files. The source code of all libaries can be found inside the `extern` directory. Installation of the SDL libaries was tested using the `configure` script.
